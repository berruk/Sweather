# Sweather

This is a web application that provides clothing outfit recommendations based on weather conditions. The project consists of a backend developed in Node.js with a frontend in React and Redux. Additionally, it utilizes RabbitMQ for communication between the Python and Node.js backend modules, and Spark is used in the Python module for data processing.

## Features

- **Weather-Based Outfit Recommendations (in-progress)**: Users can upload their clothing items, and the application recommends suitable outfits based on the current weather conditions. 

- **User Authentication**: Users can sign up and log in to access personalized outfit recommendations and save their preferences.

- **Real-Time Weather Data**: The application fetches real-time weather data from external APIs to ensure up-to-date and accurate recommendations.

- **Python and Spark Integration (in-progress)**: The Python module utilizes PySpark to perform data processing and analysis for advanced outfit recommendations. 

- **Message Queue with RabbitMQ**: The backend modules communicate through RabbitMQ, allowing efficient and asynchronous message passing.
